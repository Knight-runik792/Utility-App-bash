## Tech[subject to change]
### - Zenity
Zenity is a utility app for Linux that allows users to create graphical user interface (GUI) dialogs and windows using simple shell scripts. It is a part of the GNOME desktop environment and is based on the GTK+ toolkit.
Zenity provides a set of dialog boxes, such as message boxes, input boxes, file selection boxes, and progress bars, that can be easily integrated into shell scripts. This makes it easy for developers and system administrators to create simple GUIs for their applications or scripts without having to learn complex programming languages or libraries.



This Application uses a number of simple bash script files to work properly:
 
- [mos.bash]- main script
- fill in the names of scripts


## Installation
You can find our app through this link-*insert link*
The Utility app requires you to have the main bash file along with all the other bash files stored together locally in your system.

Once you do that, 


Run these commands in your terminal

```
cd utilityApp
```
To make your main file executable, use chmod
```
chmod 777 mos.bash
```

Now to run your main file
```
./mos.bash
```
Alternatively,
Simply write
```sh mos.bash```
in your terminal to run the application
